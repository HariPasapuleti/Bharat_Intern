## Task 1 - House Price Predictor with Linear Regression

**Overview**: Predict house prices using features like area income, house age, rooms, bedrooms, and population.  
**Dataset**: `USA_Housing.csv` with columns for income, house age, number of rooms, population, and price.  
**Process**: Preprocessed data, trained a linear regression model, and evaluated its performance using intercepts, coefficients, and residual plots.

## Task 2 - Iris Flower Classification

**Overview**: Classify iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal characteristics.  
**Dataset**: `iris.csv` with features like sepal length, width, petal length, width, and species.  
**Models**: Applied Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.  
**Conclusion**: Gaussian Naive Bayes performed well in classification, with potential improvements from hyperparameter tuning.
